1. Edit, delete or change the predefined repositories to suit your needs.
2. Go to the update tab and press update.
2a. If you get any errors, try again in ~10 seconds. If that doesn't help, try to delete the Repositories folder. If you still get them, chances are high that a repository doesn't exist anymore.
3. Set the reference path and enable the option to change them in the settings tab. 
 - (e.g. "C:\LeagueSharp\Assemblies\System")
4. Go to the compile tab and press compile.
4a. If you get any errors, open the Build directory and copy all .dll files to the defined reference path.
4b. Compile again. If you still get any errors, check if your reference path is correct and you enabled the option for it.
4c. If you still get any errors, chances are high that the project contains an error, nothing you can do about.
